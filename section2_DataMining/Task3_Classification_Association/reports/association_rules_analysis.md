# Association Rules Analysis

## Part B: Market Basket Analysis

### Dataset
- Total transactions: 40
- Unique items: 21
- Min support: 0.2
- Min confidence: 0.5

### Top Association Rule

**Rule:** cheese => pasta

**Metrics:**
- Support: 0.225
- Confidence: 0.500
- Lift: 1.818

### Interpretation

The strongest rule shows that customers who purchase cheese are highly likely to also buy pasta. The lift value of 1.82 indicates that this combination occurs 1.82 times more frequently than if the items were purchased independently. This suggests a genuine shopping pattern rather than random co-occurrence.

### Real-World Applications

**Retail Recommendations:** This rule can be used to create product recommendation systems. When a customer adds cheese to their cart, the system can suggest pasta to increase cross-selling opportunities.

**Store Layout:** Physical stores can place these items near each other to encourage impulse purchases and improve shopping convenience.

**Promotional Strategies:** Bundle these products together in special offers or discounts to boost sales of both items simultaneously. This data-driven approach helps maximize revenue while providing value to customers.

The high confidence (50.0%) means that in most cases where customers buy cheese, they also purchase pasta, making this a reliable pattern for business decisions.
